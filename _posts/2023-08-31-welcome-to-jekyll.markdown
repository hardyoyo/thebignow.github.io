Hey there,

Welcome to **The Big Now**, the digital home where the past and the present come 
together. This site started its journey as a literary magazine back in the 90s, 
but it has evolved into something more—a canvas for personal projects and a 
space for exploration.

Here, you'll find a mix of creativity, a glimpse into my world, and maybe even a 
few surprises along the way. Whether you're here out of nostalgia or curiosity, 
I'm thrilled to have you join me on this digital adventure.

Stay tuned for updates on my latest projects, thoughts on various topics, and 
who knows what else might pop up in **The Big Now**. So, kick back, explore, and 
let's make this journey together.
