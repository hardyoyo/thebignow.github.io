Explore **The Big Now**, a digital rendezvous with a rich past. From its origins
as a 90s literary magazine to its present as a haven for personal projects,
this domain has been a constant companion. As it finds a new home on GitHub
Pages, it continues to stand as witness to **the journey**â€”a space where creativity 
and curiosity intersect.
